Algorithm: Gauss Jordan:
Input: Order of the matrix, Coefficients of matrix of size n
Output: Solution Vector {x1, x2,....xn}
1. Declare the variables and read the order of the matrix n.
2. Take the coefficients of the linear equation as:
	for k=1 to n //access the rows
		for j=1 to n+1 //access the columns
			Read a[k][j]
		End for j
	End for k

3. Apply Gauss Jordan Elimination on Matrix a:
	For i = 1 to n
	    If a[i][i] = 0
	    Print "Mathematical Error!" and Stop
	    End If
	    For j = 1 to n
		If i â‰  j 
		   pivot = a[j][i]/a[i][i]
		   For k = 1 to n+1
		       a[j][k] = a[j][k] - pivot * a[i][k]
		   End k
		   End If
	    End j
	End i

4. Obtaining Solution:
	
	For i = 1 to n 
		x[i] = a[i][n+1]/a[i][i]
	End i

5. Display Solution:
	
	For i = 1 to n
		
		Print x[i]
	
	End i
6. Stop
