Algorithm: Gauss Elimination with out pivoting:
Input: Order of the matrix, Coefficients of matrix of size n
Output: Solution Vector {x1, x2,....xn}
1. Declare the variables and read the order of the matrix n.
2. Take the coefficients of the linear equation as:
	for k=1 to n //access the rows
		for j=1 to n+1 //access the columns
			Read a[k][j]
		End for j
	End for k

3. Forward Elimination: 
	for k=1 to n-1 //all the row accept last
		for i=k+1 to n //all the row accept first row
		  for j=k+1 to n+1 //access the coloums
			a[i][j] = a[i][j] – a[i][k] /a[k][k] * a[k][j]
		  End for j
		End for i
	End for k

4. Forward Substitution
	Compute x[n] = a[n][n+1]/a[n][n]
	for k=n-1 to 1 //all the row accept last row
	sum = 0
		for j=k+1 to n
			sum = sum + a[k][j] * x[j]
		End for j
	x[k] = 1/a[k][k] * (a[k][n+1] – sum)
	End for k
5. Print the soluion vector 
    	For i = 1 to n
		
		Print Xi
