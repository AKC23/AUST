1. Start 
2. Read Order of Matrix (n).
3. Read Matrix (A):
	For i = 1 to n
	  For j = 1 to n
	    Read a[i][j]
	  End j
	End i

4. Augment Identity Matrix of Order n to Matrix A:
	For i = 1 to n
	  For j = 1 to n
	    If i = j
	      A[i][j+n] = 1
	    Else
	      A[i][j+n] = 0
	    End If
	  End j
	End i

5. Apply Gauss Jordan Elimination on Augmented Matrix (a):
	For i = 1 to n
	    If a[i][i] = 0
	    Print "Mathematical Error!" and Stop
	    End If
	    For j = 1 to n
		If i â‰  j 
		   pivot = a[j][i]/a[i][i]
		   For k = 1 to n+1
		       a[j][k] = a[j][k] - pivot * a[i][k]
		   End k
		   End If
	    End j
	End i
	
6. Row Operation to Convert Principal Diagonal to 1.
	
	For i = 1 to n
	  For j = n+1 to 2*n
	    a[i][j] = A[i][j]/A[i][i]
	  End j
	End i
	
7. Display Inverse Matrix:

	For i = 1 to n
	  For j = n+1 to 2*n
	    Print a[i][j]
	  End j
	End i

8. Stop
