Algorithm: Gauss Seidel Method:
Input: Order of the matrix, Coefficients of matrix of size n and vector b
Output: Solution Vector {x1, x2,....xn}
1. Declare the variables and read the order of the matrix n.
2. Take the coefficients of the linear equation as:
	for k=1 to n //access the rows
		for j=1 to n //access the columns
			Read a[k][j]
		End for j
	End for k
3. Take the vector b
	for i=1 to n
           Read b[i]

4. Choose initial guess x(0) to the solution x
	for i=0 to n-1
            x(0)[i] = 0

5. Apply Gauss Seidel Iterations:
   For k = 0 to k_max //k denotes iterative values of x vector
	For i = 1 to n
	    sum = 0
	    For j = 1 to i-1
		sum = sum + a[j][i]x(k+1)[j]
	    End j
            For j = i+1 to n
		sum = sum + a[j][i]x(k)[j]
	    End j
    	    x(k+1)[i] = sum/a[i][i]
	End i
    Check |x(k+1) - x(k)|>error then continue
    End k

6. Display Solution:
	
	For i = 1 to n
		
		Print x[i]
	
	End i
7. Stop
